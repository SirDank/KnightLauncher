## Features
- Install and uninstall game mods in an easy and noob-friendly way without worrying about game updates.
- Jump into several editors such as a model viewer and a scene editor to create custom user-generated content.
- Automatically patch your game to use a 64-bit Java VM to improve the game's performance.
- Re-install and verify your game files with ease.
- Intuitive and user-friendly UI for configuring advanced Java VM settings.
- Discord integration that shows your current game activity on your Discord status. This feature is only available on Windows.
- Launch alt accounts with lesser resources assigned to them avoiding losing performance on your main instance.
- Future-proofed to support third party servers. Third party server support __**will not**__ be enabled while Grey Havens' Official servers are still online, unless explicitly permitted by their respective right owners and/or law.
- And more...

## Downloading & Installing

1. Prerequisites:
   - [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed.
2. Download the latest Knight Launcher release ZIP file [here](https://github.com/SirDank/KnightLauncher/releases/latest).
3. Extract the downloaded `KnightLauncher-x.x.x.zip` ZIP file to your Spiral Knights folder (`x.x.x` will vary depending on the current version).
   - **Windows**: Steam installations can be found by right-clicking the game on your Steam library and selecting "Manage" â†’ "Browse Local Files," you can also look for it at `<Your Steam Folder>\steamapps\common\Spiral Knights`. Standalone installations can be found by right-clicking the Spiral Knights shortcut on your desktop and then clicking "Open File Location," you can also look for it at `<Your User Folder>\AppData\LocalLow\spiral`.
   - **macOS**: Steam installations can be found at `/Users/<Your User Folder>/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Spiral Knights/`. Standalone installations can be found at `/Users/<Your User Folder>/Library/Application Support/spiral`. For both types of installations you'll find a `Spiral Knights.app` file which you need to open, then browse to `Contents/Resources/Java`, this is the game's folder.
   - **Linux**: Steam installations are not natively supported, but the launcher will still call Steam and launch through Proton if you place Knight Launcher's JAR file in the game's folder. Standalone installations are found at your user's home folder then `.getdown/spiral`.
   - Bear in mind that these are the *usual* installation locations, your mileage may vary.
4. Double-click the `KnightLauncher.jar` JAR file. The launcher should now boot up.
5. If nothing happens, double-click the `KnightLauncher_windows.bat` file or `KnightLauncher_mac_linux.sh` file depending on your operating system.

## Updating

The launcher is capable of auto-updating itself given the option is enabled in the launcher's settings, which will be by default. To manually update, follow these steps:
1. Download the latest Knight Launcher release ZIP file [here](https://github.com/SirDank/KnightLauncher/releases/latest).
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your Spiral Knights folder, the same way you did when installing it for the first time. Guidance on finding your game folder can be found above at "Downloading & Installing."

After following those steps, the launcher will be up to date.
